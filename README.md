# OpenAI-RAG-tutorial
Hello and welcome! This is a three-stage tutorial to educate how to effectively implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI, Pinecone, and Langchain.

The three parts of this tutorial include:

1) Building an AI Chatbot
2) Embedding PDFs into a vector space
3) Building a simple RAG application

Each of the folders labeled parts 1-3 each have a respective tutorial video to follow along.



I strongly recommend using a virtual environment to create an isolated and stable version of Python to work on through this tutorial:

python -m venv vir

For windows (Comand Prompt):

vir\Scripts\activate.bat

You should create a virtual environment for each part of the tutorial.


Each of the tutorials also have their own dependencies that need to be installed for the files to work properly. A requirements.txt file has been included in each folder and should be used for the part that they are located in.

To install:

pip install -r requirements.txt
